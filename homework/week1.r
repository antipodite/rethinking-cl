# Globe tossing example with numbers from book:

# Homework exercise 1
# "Suppose the globe tossing data (Chapter 2) had turned out to be 4 water
#  and 11 land. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation.
#  Use the same flat prior as in the book."
# The same calculation, but we tossed the globe 15 times and got 4 water and
# 11 land:
prior <- rep(1, 1000)
samples <- gridApprox(1000, 4, 15, prior)
plot(samples)
dens(samples)

# Homework exercise 2
# "Now suppose the data are 4 water and 2 land. Compute the posterior
#  again, but this time use a prior that is zero below p = 0.5 and a constant
#  above p = 0.5. This corresponds to prior information that a majority of the
#  Earthâ€™s surface is water."

# Homework exercise 3
# "For the posterior distribution from 2, compute 89% percentile and HPDI
#  intervals. Compare the widths of these intervals. Which is wider? Why? If
#  you had only the information in the interval, what might you misunderstand
#  about the shape of the posterior distribution?"
